        <h4>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class. </h4>
        <p>
            My painful lack of familiarity with web/mobile systems in past design projects prompted me to take this class. 
        </p>

        <li>
        <h4>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</h4>
        <p>
            I've tried to take a bootcamp but could not follow through. 
        </p>

        <li>
        <h4>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</h4>
        <p>
            In this class, I hope to learn more about flexible design systems in web/mobile interactions.

        <li>
        <h4>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</h4>
        <p>
            I expect that designing for web is less about fixing a perfect visual solution than about creating a responsive system. 
        </p>

        <li>
        <h4>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice. </h4>
        <p> 
            https://www.figma.com/

        <p>   
        I chose this website because it uses visual communication effectively by incorporating motion and graphics to indicate what users can do. This effectively reduces reading time and avoids unnecessary extra search.

            https://mailchimp.com/
        </p>
        <p>
            I think this website provides short actions phrases to guide the users; the interface is slightly overwhelming but the use of the color yellow provides an actionable thread to follow.

            This is a resource website for typography. It is very easy to use, organizes image documents very effectively by keywords, and adapts well to resizing the website dimensions.
