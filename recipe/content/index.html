            <h3>Mushroom Risotto with Peas</h3>
            <p>Description: I've always wanted to make my own mushroom risotto ever since studying abroad in Florence. I love the dish for its earthy and savory flavors combined with a creamy sauce.The slow cooking time of the broth and the number of aromatic make the recipe somewhat hard to follow. I hope structuring a website can help with the process.</p>
            <p>Calories per Serving: Approximately 350-400 calories (depending on cheese and broth used)</p>
            <p>Ingredient Preparation Time: 10-15 minutes</p>
            <p>Cook Time: 30-35 minutes</p>

            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Bring stock or broth to a simmer in a saucepan, with a ladle nearby. Make sure stock is well seasoned, and keep it simmering on the stove.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Heat oil in a wide, heavy nonstick skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add onions or shallots and cook gently until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Turn up heat and add mushrooms. Cook, stirring, until they begin to sweat, about 3 minutes, then add garlic and thyme or sage. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Season mushrooms with salt and pepper and continue to cook over medium heat until they are soft. Taste and adjust seasoning.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add rice and stir until grains begin to crackle. Add wine and cook, stirring, until wine is no longer visible in pan. Stir in enough simmering stock to just cover the rice. The stock should bubble slowly. Cook, stirring often and vigorously, until stock is just about absorbed. Add another ladleful or two of stock and continue cooking, not too fast and not too slowly, stirring often and adding more stock when rice is almost dry, for 15 minutes.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add peas, if using, and continue adding stock and stirring for another 10 minutes. Rice should be tender all the way through but still al dente. Taste now and adjust seasoning.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add another ladleful or two of stock to rice. Stir in parsley and Parmesan, and remove from heat. Season with black pepper and serve right away in wide soup bowls or on plates.
                </li>

                <br>

                <p>
                    Advance preparation: You can begin up to several hours before serving: proceed with the recipe and cook halfway through Step 4, for about 10 minutes. The rice should still be hard in the middle when you remove it from the heat, and there should not be any liquid in the pan. Spread it in an even layer in the pan or on a baking sheet and keep it away from the heat until you resume cooking. 15 minutes before serving, resume cooking as instructed.
                </p>

                <p>Serving Risotto: The goal is to serve it immediately while it's still rich and creamy. Risotto should be served warm, around 140-160°F (60-71°C). It should be creamy and slightly loose when it leaves the pot, as it continues to thicken as it cools. </p>

                <p>Storing and Keeping Leftover Risotto:
                    
                    Cool it down quickly: Spread the leftover risotto out on a baking sheet or shallow container to cool it quickly and prevent it from clumping.
                    
                    Refrigerate: Once cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
                    
                    </p>
