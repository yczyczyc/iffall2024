        <p>This deeply flavorful, creamy mushroom risotto is simply made with sautéed mushrooms, shallots, a touch of white wine, and arborio rice with some fresh Parmesan cheese. It's one of the most delicious variations on basic risotto you can make. It's easy, too—all you need is 40-50 minutes, plus your undivided attention as you ladle and stir your way to risotto perfection.</p>

                <ul class="list-of-ingredients">
                    <li>1 quart mushroom stock (or vegetable stock or chicken stock)</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
                    <li>1 cup fresh mushrooms, sliced (cremini or wild mushrooms)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1 medium shallot (or small onion), chopped (about 1/2 cup)</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups arborio rice</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Italian parsley, chopped</li>
                    <li>Fine salt, to taste</li>

                        <p><strong>Choosing Mushrooms:</strong>
                        You can use any type of mushroom you like for this recipe, including regular button mushrooms, cremini, portobellos, shiitakes, and wild mushrooms such as chanterelles and porcini. The mushrooms are <b>sautéed</b>, which intensifies their flavor, so even the mildest mushrooms will taste wonderful in this dish.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>The rice really matters: </strong>
                            <b> Arborio rice </b>is a classic—and wonderful—choice for risotto, and it is readily available in stores and online. This medium-grain, high-starch rice becomes wonderfully creamy when cooked, so it's perfect for risotto.

                            Two excellent Arborio rice substitutes are <b>carnaroli</b> and <b>Vialone Nano</b>, which are both high-starch varieties often used in Italian kitchens for this dish. Avoid long-grain rice varieties like basmati and jasmine as these will not result in a creamy risotto.</p>

                        <p class="notes"> If you run out of stock and the risotto still isn't done, you can finish the cooking using hot water. Just add the water as you did with the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring until it's absorbed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tips for Serving Risotto.</strong> </p>
                        <p>Serve it immediately while it's still rich and creamy! Risotto should be served warm, around 140-160°F (60-71°C). It should be creamy and slightly loose when it leaves the pot, as it continues to thicken as it cools. </p>

                    <p><strong>Tips for Storing and Keeping Leftovers.</strong> </p>
                    <p>Cool it down quickly: Spread the leftover risotto out on a baking sheet or shallow container to cool it quickly and prevent it from clumping.</p>
                    <p> Refrigerate: Once cooled, store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
